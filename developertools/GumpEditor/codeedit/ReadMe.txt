This is a sample program how to use the excellent Scintilla edit control of Neil Hodgson.
See www.scintilla.org for details. I have seen a lot of requests for a MFC sample program
in the scintilla mailing list. 
The scintillamfc application tries to show some of the scintilla features in a typical MFC application.
- Syntax coloring
- Source folding
- Bookmarks
Most of the work is done in the CscintillamfcView.cpp and CScintillaWnd.cpp code. Take a look
there. There is a piece of HTML documentation in scinmfc.htm.



Environment: VisualC++ Version 6, static Build of Scintilla, SciLexer.dll as Lexer<nl>
