/// pathsearch by ghoulsblade
/// this gets called if the file pointed to by the path does not exist
/// the function will try listing directory contents and search for the path ignoring case
/// this should help using the original UO files without renaming on case sensitive file systems (esp. linux)
/// returns correct path on success, or empty string on failure
/// WARNING ! attempts to list directory contents, which has to use platform specific functions, only implemented for linux so far
/// not needed on win as win filesystems are case insensitive
/// ghoulsblade : i don't know how to do that on mac, but they can get it running by renaming the files to lowercase i guess...
